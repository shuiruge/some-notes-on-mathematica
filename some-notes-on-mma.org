* Some Notes on Mma.

** dir[]
   Usually, we make a long long derive, then for a while, we forget what quantity some letter
   denoting for. This happens generally not only in programming, but also in deriving by hands.
   As what python does, we can construct a list called "dir", which contains such information of
   each notation we use. Such as '{...{\tau_N, "the conformal time at N e-foldings"}...}'. And
   function like 'dir[]' can be used for searching such things within this 'dir' list.
